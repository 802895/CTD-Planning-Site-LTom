    <h1> Introductions to Winter Fair (Website)</h1>
    <br>
    <p> This website will be designed to help the PTA in AIS allow their Winter Fair volunteers to easily sign up to help out</p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <ol> <strong> Brainstorm </strong>
        <li> Help my friend make his website better </li>
        <li> Help a family member transfer his blog into a website</li>
        <li> Create a website for a friend </li>
        <li> Make a website for the Jordan Leadership Club </li>
        <li> Make a website for the Student Council </li>
        <li> Make a website for students to have a voice in the AIS community </li>
        <li> Make a website that allows people to view what is on winter fair each year </li>
        <li>We had an idea of what the website will contain and created a flow chart.
        </br> <h2> FlowChart 1 </h2><img src="Images/FlowChart%20for%20Site.png"/></li>
        <h2> FlowChart 2 </h2> <img src="Images/Flow Chart Na.png"/>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <hr> <p>  <strong> Client's (PTA) request </strong>
      <li> Want a page which parents can sign up for voluntary work </li>
      <ol>  <li> Set up </li>
        <li> Clean up </li>
        <li> Preperation </li>
        <li> Food Donation</li>
        <li> multi language </li>
        <li> After we listened to our Client's request we had a different flow chart
        </br><h2> Final FlowChart </h2><img src="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/W7%20Webpg/CTD-Planning-Site-LTom/Images/FlowChart%20for%20SIte%20(AfterContact).png"/></li>
      </ol>
    </br>
    We made this people it meets the Client's needs. This is easier and simpler than the one we thought before.
  </br>
  The audiences are most likely housewifes who do not use the internet alot so it will only be one click away from what they want.

<p> <span class="u">Feedback</span> for Story board. The bars and contact list and everything is too big need to be resized.</br>
  Furtheremore, the color contrast can be made better if ligher colors are used.</br>
  Lastly the pictures should be placed in a better place. </p>

  <ol> Pros and Cons of using Firework</ol>
  <ul>Pros
    <li>- I can easily make a prototype on </li>
    <li>- It is easy to change components of the webpage later on </li>
    <li>- Easy to create multi layer webpages because you can turn certain layers on and off</li>
    <li>- When optimizing your pictures, the qualities do not change</li>
    <ul>
      <br>
      <ul>Cons
        <li>- There are many tools and may be confusing</li>
        <li>- It is really hard for beginners(like me) to use </li>
        <li>- Need to open other programs to use other tools(firework dont have all the tools needed) </li>
        <li>- </li>
        <ul>
