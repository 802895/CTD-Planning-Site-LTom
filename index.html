      <li> Help a family member transfer his blog into a website</li>
      <li> Create a website for a friend </li>

    <li> Want a page which parents can sign up for voluntary work </li>

    <li> Clean up </li>
    <li> Preperation </li>
    <li> Food Donation</li>
    <li> multi language </li>

<p> <span class="u">Feedback</span> for Story board. The bars and contact list and everything is too big need to be resized.</br>
Furtheremore, the color contrast can be made better if ligher colors are used.</br>
Lastly the pictures should be placed in a better place. </p>
