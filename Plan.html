<h3> WireFrame 5</h3>

  <h3> Why we made this</h3>
  We picked wireframes from our previous ideas because the pages and the other pages and homepage should look almost the same so we based our wiresframes off the other homepages.
</br>
Our <a href=#olddy> old homepage</a> did not match with our subpages so we picked a wireframe that would give a simliar feel to everypage.

 <h3>Feedback</h3>
 <p>We discussed the pros and cons of the contact bar. It will allow people
   to see the numberes and emails faster. However,the contact bar
   on the bottom is not really used because parents, our audience, ususally
   do not know that the thing on the bottom is the contact bar.

<h3> Picking our template</h3>
<p> We decided that the bar on the bottom was not really needed and the second one is more organized, so we used the second one as our template</p>
  <h2> Look and Feel </h2>
  <p> The message of our website giving out overall is that we want
    the audience, parents, to look at it and feel that it is simple and easy to use with simple one click sign ups.</p>
<p> The theme of our background is blue because it gives a relaxing effect. Our words are in small boxes which prevents the readers to read on a long line of text, then having to find the next line </p>

<p>During the process of learning and working with out client, we noticed that the upcoming news part
of the page is futile.</br> It does not help parents because parents who actually want to come and help out
will do it today and not on a future day. Thus the news does not concern the parents.
