  <h2> Look and Feel </h2>
  <p> The message of our website giving out overall is that we want
    the audience, parents, to look at it and feel connected with
    their children leading them to sign up and volunteer for the winter
    fair.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Excellent planning: very organised</li>
  <li>Color contrast is VERY VERY VERY bad</li>
  <li>Functional, but the website could be more organised</li>
  <li>Make sure you divide work amongs your teamates equally, because it seems like you did most of the work.</li>
</ol>
